## 🧪 Methodology

1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:
   - Different lengths
   - Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
2. Tested each password on online strength checker tools.
3. Collected and analyzed password scores, crack times, and feedback.
4. Researched common password attack methods.
5. Identified best practices for creating secure passwords.

## 📊 Sample Passwords and Results

| Password | Score (%) | Estimated Crack Time | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| `password123` | 26% | A few seconds | Too common, low complexity |
| `P@ssw0rd!` | 64% | 1 hour | Still predictable |
| `G7$eRk!9qm` | 96% | 34 years | Strong |
| `Zq!7cM8*rL&Bx1` | 100% | Centuries | Very strong |
| `12345678` | 8% | Instantly | Very weak |
| `iloveyou` | 10% | Instantly | Common phrase |

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Passwords should be **at least 12–16 characters**.
- Use a mix of:
  - **Uppercase & lowercase letters**
  - **Numbers**
  - **Symbols**
- Avoid dictionary words, common phrases, and personal info.
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `Blue!Monkey$Chair7`).
- Store passwords securely using a **password manager**.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.

## 🕵️ Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force** | Tries all combinations until correct |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a list of common passwords |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked credentials from breaches |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Password strength is critical to security. The more complex and unique a password is, the harder it is to crack using automated tools or attacks. Strong password habits are the foundation of good cybersecurity hygiene.
